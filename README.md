# Restaurant service smart contract rust

## About 

This is a restaurant service contract where clients can get to a restaurant and get the restaurant's
near account. With it, they can check the menu, make food orders, add ratings and also pay for their food items.
This can all be done securely and anoymously by leveraging on the characteristics of blockchains.
<br/>

## Initialization for dependencies needed <br/>
Borsh is the recommended serialization method for near smart contract development.

    use near_sdk::borsh::{self, BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
    use near_sdk::{env, log, near_bindgen};
    use std::collections::HashMap;


External modules for handling the information to be shown to the user on call of the 'hello' function. The payments module contains the testing function for the payments method.

    mod info;
    mod payments;


HashMaps are used to store multiple sessions of different clients on different unique tables.
A list of food choices that the restaurant offers and prices for each also here
Table numbers are therefore used as keys.
All_ratings stores all ratings made by clients and the avg_rating stored the final computed average rating.

    pub struct Contract {
        menu: HashMap<String, f32>,
        table_allocation: HashMap<u8, Client>,
        all_ratings: Vec<u8>,
        avg_rating: f32,
    }

This is all the clients information we'll be storing per table in the contract.table_allocation, that is the food the client requested, the table and also the cost of the food in NEAR.

    pub struct Client {
        ...//initialization here
    }
## Implimentation of the Contract struct


    impl Contract {
        ...// implimentation here
    }

Call to get initial instructions on how to use contract with the current restaurant avarage ratings.

    pub fn hello(&self) {
        info::hello(self.avg_rating);
    }


 Initialization function for the contract and setting the initial avg_rating.
 Note: Private thus only called by restaurant owner or the initial account only.
 
    #[result_serializer(borsh)]
    #[init]
    #[private]
    pub fn new() -> Contract {
        Contract {
            menu: info::menu_items(),
            table_allocation: HashMap::new(),
            all_ratings: Vec::new(),
            avg_rating: 5.0,
        }
    }
## Main food order function

The main function with which the client calls to make an meal order. The client passes his food choice and table number.
The data provided is used to initialized a new instance of a client object only if the food provided exists in the Contract.menu HashMap.

    pub fn main(&mut self, table_number: u8, food_choice: String) {
        ...// initialization
    }

    pub fn main(&mut self, table_number: u8, food_choice: String) {
        // convert food_choice from string to str so that it can be used to iterate through MENU_ITEMS
        // let food: &str = &*food_choice;
        log!("Table number {} your order is {} ", &table_number, &food_choice);
        // Check if the client's food exists in the MENU_ITEMS
        if self.menu.contains_key(&food_choice) {
            env::log_str("Your order is confirmed");
            // // Get the index of the food from the MENU_ITEMS so as to match the order's price
            // let food_index: usize = MENU_ITEMS.iter().position(|&x| x == &food_choice).unwrap();
            // The cost is currently in dollars thus divided by the current value of NEAR to convert it to near
            let cost: f32 = self.menu[&food_choice]; // 5.64
            let client_new = Client {
                table: table_number,
                food: food_choice,
                cost: cost,
            };
            // call the add_client method passing the generated Client and the table_number as key
            self.add_client(client_new.clone(), table_number);
            log!(
                "Your food should cost: {} near",
                self.table_allocation[&table_number].cost
            );
        } else {
            env::log_str("Your item does not exist in our inventory, please try again");
        };
    }

## Payment Method

A payable function where clients can pay for their meals using NEAR tokens with near attached to the function call.

    #[payable]
    pub fn pay(&mut self, table_number: u8) {
        ...// initialization
    }

    #[payable]
    pub fn pay(&mut self, table_number: u8) {
        // Assign attached near and the cost of food for the table to variables
        let tokens = env::attached_deposit();
        let charge = self.table_allocation[&table_number].cost;
        log!("deposited {} ", tokens);
        // convert unsigned integer to float and yocto to near
        let token_near = to_near(tokens);
        log!("cost: {}, token near {}", charge, token_near);
        // if checks to compare the token recieved to the expected charge for the meals and give relevant feedback
        if token_near <= 0.00002 {
            env::log_str("unsuccessful");
            return
        } if token_near + 0.00002 > charge {
            log!(
                "You paid more by {} we hope it's a tip",
                (token_near - charge)
            );
            return;
        } if token_near + 0.00002 < charge {
            log!(
                "You paid less by {} please consider paying up",
                (charge - token_near)
            );
            return;
        } else {
                env::log_str("successful");
                return;

        }
        // Compute a new average rating and Update it to the Restaurant struct

    fn to_near(yocto: u128) -> f32 {

## Unit tests

    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests {
        use super::*;

Test the new and main methods agains Prawns and Fried egg whose properties are predefined struct contract.menu.

    #[test]
    fn create_user_1() {
        let mut contract = Contract::new();
        contract.main(2, "Prawns".to_string());
        contract.main(4, "Fried egg".to_string());
        assert_eq!(2, contract.table_allocation.len());
        // assert right food is served
        assert_eq!("Prawns".to_string(), contract.table_allocation[&2].food); 
        let prawns_cost = 5.0; // price of prawns read directly from the MENU_PRICES array
        // assert if price is correct for the food ordered
        assert_eq!(prawns_cost, contract.table_allocation[&2].cost);
    }
<br>
Here we test that no one should be able to rate our restaurant if not a valid client with a registered table allocation.
The test is expected to fail as the ratings should not change.

    #[test]
    #[should_panic]
        fn add_ratings_without_table() {
            let mut contract = Contract::new();
            contract.ratings(42, 3); // 2 is client rating and 3 is table number
            assert!(5.0 > contract.avg_rating); // average rating should be lower if the rating is added
        }
We test if when a valid client rating the restaurant there's change on the restaurants average rating.

    #[test]
    fn add_ratings() {
        let mut contract = Contract::new();
        contract.main(2, "Prawns".to_string());
        assert_eq!(5.0, contract.avg_rating);
        contract.ratings(4, 2); // 4 is client rating and 2 is table number
        assert!(5.0 > contract.avg_rating); // average rating should be lower
    }

Due to it being payable, the tests fo pay are generic and depending on the external module `mod payments::pay_test()` function for simulation purposes.\
We call the `mod payments::pay_test()` with various "NEAR" to simulate less, more, excact and method call without attached near.\
The function responds with "status codes" for each: `-1` for less, `0` for none, `1` for equal and `2` for excess.

    #[test]
        fn pay_test(){
        // fried egg is used which costs 3 dollars or near
        // Paying excess
            let mut contract = Contract::new();
            contract.main(5, "Fried egg".to_string()); 
            let token: u128 = 2 * u128::pow(10, 24); 
            // convert 2 near to equivalent yocto
            let cost = contract.table_allocation[&5].cost;
            let status: i8 = payments::pay_test(token, cost);
            assert_eq!(-1, status);
